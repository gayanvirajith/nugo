            <p>
                I am a developer (who works on the web) from Sri Lanka. Working for <a href="http://template-factory.nl" target="_blank">Template-factory.nl</a> (Mearch ICT),
                specialized in web development. I prefer to serve with Php and Ruby based stacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                I graduated from the University College Dublin (National University of Ireland) with a Bsc in MIS (2012).

                I love to work on <a href="http://processwire.com" target="_blank">ProcessWire CMS/CMF</a> and with Ruby + Jekyll.
                I am also writing to <a title="ProcessWire friendly community forum" href="http://processwire.com/talk" target="_blank">ProcessWire friendly community</a> forum among others.
                I really love open-source and try to <a href="https://github.com/gayanvirajith" target="_blank">give free stuff</a> as much as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time I make ProcessWire site profiles. The recent site profile that I made was <a
                    href="https://github.com/gayanvirajith/BlueVrSiteProfile" target="_blank">Blue-VR</a> which is freely available on Github.
